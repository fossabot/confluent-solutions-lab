### Migration to TGW

# Step 1: Attach your VPC to the TGW

data "aws_ec2_transit_gateway" "input" {
  id = var.transit_gateway_id
}

resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment" "attachment" {
  subnet_ids = [
    aws_subnet.public_subnet_1.id,
    aws_subnet.public_subnet_2.id,
    aws_subnet.public_subnet_3.id
  ]
  transit_gateway_id = data.aws_ec2_transit_gateway.input.id
  vpc_id             = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
}

# Step 2: Share TGW with Confluent Cloud

resource "aws_ram_resource_share" "confluent" {
  name                      = "resource-share-with-confluent"
  allow_external_principals = true
}

resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "confluent" {
  principal          = confluent_network.peering.aws[0].account
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.confluent.arn
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "example" {
  resource_arn       = data.aws_ec2_transit_gateway.input.arn
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.confluent.arn
}

# Step 3: Create TGW Attachment on CC

resource "confluent_transit_gateway_attachment" "aws" {
  display_name = "AWS Transit Gateway Attachment"
  aws {
    ram_resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.confluent.arn
    transit_gateway_id     = data.aws_ec2_transit_gateway.input.id
    routes                 = ["10.0.0.0/15"]
  }
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.staging.id
  }
  network {
    id = confluent_network.peering.id
  }
}

# Step 4: Accept TGW attachment on AWS

data "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment" "accepter" {
  id = confluent_transit_gateway_attachment.aws.aws[0].transit_gateway_attachment_id
}

resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment_accepter" "accepter" {
  transit_gateway_attachment_id = data.aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment.accepter.id
}

# Step 5: Change route table to send traffic to TGW instead of Peering (manual step in AWS). Make sure all clients are still working.

# Step 6: Delete the peering connection on Confluent Cloud (manual step in CC). Once this is done, confirm that the peering has also been deleted on AWS automatically.

# Step 7: Work with Confluent support to swap the broader CIDR with the narrow one. This needs to be done in a specific way to make sure there is no disruption.
